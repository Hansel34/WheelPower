# WheelPower

WheelPower was a capstone project intended to increase travel distance and reduce muscle fatigue of those who utilize manual wheelchairs.
The challenge was to create an electromechanical system that could automatically detect inclines and provide enough assisting force to reduce the stress and strain of manually travelling up a ramp.

This project was "completed" in April 2018, and development has ceased since.
